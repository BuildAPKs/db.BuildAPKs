BuildAPKs GitHub ` *NAMES ` README.md

The ` build.github*.bash ` commands use the ~/buildAPKs/var/db directory to assist in building APKs from GitHub.  The [db.BuildAPKs](https://github.com/BuildAPKs/db.BuildAPKs/) repository is this directory archived.  The git repository [db.BuildAPKs](https://github.com/BuildAPKs/db.BuildAPKs/) installs as a module into ~/buildAPKs/opt/db once https://github.com/BuildAPKs is installed.

BASH command [`build.github.bash`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BuildAPKs/buildAPKs.github/master/build.github.bash) can build all the APK repos in a GitHub account on device today!  When you find a GitHub username that builds with buildAPKs, consider adding to buildAPKs by submitting a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) at [db.BuildAPKs/pulls](https://github.com/BuildAPKs/db.BuildAPKs/pulls) by adding to one or more of the ` *NAMES ` files, and possibly to an appropriate ` ma.bash ` file with project source code commit reference if a project merritt's this inclusion.

Two very simple pull requests can be submitted:  One in db.BuildAPKs by adding a name to the corresponding ` *NAMES ` file or files, a login name in each corresponding file per GitHub account.  The second pull request can be added in an appropriate [BuildAPKs](https://github.com/BuildAPKs) module repository by adding an <code> _AT_ </code> line in the suitable ma.bash file, one line of code per project.  If a GitHub account has many interesting projects, then multiple buildAPKs module repositories can recieve pull requests regarding the same user's projects.    

1) To see the available ma.bash files you can use: 
<code> find ~/buildAPKs/sources/ -type f -name ma.bash -exec cat {} \; </code>

2) The lines concerning individual APK projects in ma.bash are: 
<code> grep -hr _AT_ ~/buildAPKs/sources/ </code>

The ma.bash file usage is: <code> _AT_ login/repo commit </code> and the file ~/buildAPKs/.gitmodules has information about each module repository.  The modules located in ~/buildAPKs/sources/ contain module themed ma.bash files.  Running ~/buildAPKs/build.buildAPKs.modules.bash will populate the ` .gitmodules ` file and the modules.  The <code> _AT_ </code> function itself is located in <code> grep -r _AT_ ~/buildAPKs/scripts/ </code> after the corresponding modules have been cloned into the ~/buildAPKs directory.

Files var/db/[BEOU]NAMES may contain duplicate names.  Depreciated file ` rm.dups.bash ` has more information.  

Files ~/buildAPKs/var/db/[PRXZ]NAMES may also contain duplicate names. However, these files halt the build process.  Remove the corresponding account name from the var/db/[PRXZ]NAMES file(s) and the ~/buildAPKs/sources/github/{orgs,users}/name directory to continue to attempt to process this Github login if BuildAPKs created this directory.  Removing the corresponding ~/buildAPKs/sources/github/{orgs,users}/name directory and the name from the NAMES file(s) will continue the build process this Github login.

These files are located in ~/buildAPKs/var/db and their purpose is outlined in this table:

[Awk](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/) can be used ` awk 'NR>=20 && NR<=52' ~/buildAPKs/var/db/README.md ` to view the \*NAMES files table in this file.  Use ` grep ∆ ~/buildAPKs/var/db/README.md ` to view only the \*NAMES system files and their definition.

Change requests to the database located at [db.BuildAPKs](https://github.com/BuildAPKs/db.BuildAPKs/) may be proposed [here](https://github.com/BuildAPKs/db.BuildAPKs/pulls).

This command: ` grep NAMES ~/buildAPKs/var/db/README.md | grep \| | awk '{print $2}' | cut -c 1 | sort | uniq | cat ` assists in maintaining the file name structure.  These files contain data pair types:

| DNAMES ∆     | login names and built date pairs |
| FNAMES ∆     | login names and build time pairs |
| GNAMES ∆     | login names and login type pairs |
| MNAMES ∆     | login names and number of AndroidManifest.xml files pairs |
| SNAMES ∆     | login names and download size pairs |
| WNAMES ∆     | login names and built APK projects pairs |

NOTE:  Adding a username token pair to ~/buildAPKs/.conf/GAUTH will increase the rate limit for authenticated users of GitHub.  Use this OATH token file to enable OAuth authentication.  To create an OAuth token, you can use https://github.com/settings/tokens and insert this token into the first line in GAUTH.  File [GAUTH](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BuildAPKs/buildAPKs/master/.conf/GAUTH) has more information.
